        <h3>October 5th, Music & Mental Health</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Host: Musician Jane Muljoto</li>
          <li>Host: Psychiatric Dr. Seth Ash</li>
          <li>Available Seats: 1,499 of 10,000</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Research shows the benefits of music therapy for various mental health
          conditions, including depression, trauma, and schizophrenia (to name a
          few). Music acts as a medium for processing emotions, trauma, and
          griefâ€”but music can also be utilized as a regulating or calming agent
          for anxiety or for dysregulation. During this course we hope to not
          only teach you a few chords but also how to respectfully manage your
          own mental health through helpful advice and good vibes.
